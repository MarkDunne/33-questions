This is a place to question fundamental assumptions.

----------------

1. **Extend address space from 33 bits to 36 bits.** The number of humans who have ever lived
is estimated to be about 10^11; this is sufficient to handle current requirements but what about
scalability?

2. **Geolocation.** 16 bits for lat/lon of birth location gives approximately 1 degree of
resolution on the surface of the earth, enough to narrow it down to a city, but what if that
city is Beijing or London? Only about 16,000 of those uniform patches will have anybody in them;
almost seventy percent (except for islands) will be wasted.
